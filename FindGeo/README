To use FindGeo you must have Java version 17 or greater. 

Many Linux/Mac systems already have a version of Java installed. Check the installed version by running: java -version

If the installed version is lower than version 17, you can still install version 17 as several versions can safely co-exist.
In that case, you can download the compressed tar file from https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/ site and unpack it in any folder, e.g. /opt and run FindGeo with:

/opt/<java-version>/bin/java -jar FindGeo-1.0.jar

Otherwise, if you have Java 17 or greater, you can run ./FindGeo.sh
